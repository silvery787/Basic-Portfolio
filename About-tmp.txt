I am Software Engineer, who almost forgot how much fun programming is! I had several years break in my career and now I am a student in UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. Hopefully this will help me to refresh my knowledge and learn something new.
I started my career as a software engineer in Institute for Nuclear Research, developing and implementing algorithms for physics experiments. Later I switched on web development in an outsoursing company and dealt with both front-end and back-end development.
I decided to be a programmer when I was a 12-year-old kid, even before I actually saw a computer for the first time. Several times after I was considering different professions, but always ended up in software development. So it seems like my destiny =) I can't wait to get back!
