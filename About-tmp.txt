I am a software engineer, who almost forgot how much fun programming is! I had a break in my career for almost 7 years. Now I am a student at UC Berkeley Coding Boot camp. Hopefully, this will help me to refresh my knowledge and learn something new.

I started my career at the Institute for Nuclear Research, developing and implementing algorithms for physics experiments. Later I switched to web development in an outsourcing company and dealt with both front-end and back-end development.

I decided to become a programmer when I was 12 years old, even before I actually saw a computer for the first time. Later, I was considering different professions but always ended up in software development. So it seems like destiny! I can't wait to get back!
